        You never know what to expect! Toughestnote73 is the wildcard of the trio, the miner. always up for a new adventure (or a little mayhem). If something explodes or a random house appears in the middle of nowhere, he’s probably behind it. Building, battling, or trolling, he keeps the world interesting! in the real world, he is the youngest, a grade 10th student. comming to hobbies, tell him nothing except cooking. the chef of the house.
